A Python-based simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is beginner-friendly and serves as a great starting point for understanding Python functions, loops, and dictionaries.

## Features

- **Addition**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another (handles negative results).
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another (handles floating-point numbers).
- **Continuous Calculations**: Perform consecutive calculations with the previous result.

## How It Works

- The calculator is a command-line application.
- Users input two numbers and choose an operation.
- The result is displayed, and users can decide to continue with the current result or   start a new calculation.

*
/
Pick an operation: +
What is the second number? 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15.0, otherwise to start new calculation type 'n': y
```

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Concepts**: Functions, Loops, Dictionaries, User Input

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Create a GUI version using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
